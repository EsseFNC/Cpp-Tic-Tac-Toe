# Cpp-Tic-Tac-Toe
This if one of my best C++ projects that i've ever made so far.
Basically i'ts just a simple tic tac toe game where the user can play against the computer or against another player.
I've spent a week making this project and it's from some months ago too: i had just learned multi-dimensional arrays and i wanted to train/test my C++ skills with it.
I really hope you enjoy it and if you have some tip, i'm all ears. Thank you!
